# Car_price_prediction
This project develops predictive models to estimate the market value of used cars based on a range of features. By analyzing historical sales data, I seek to understand how various attributes, such as a car's age, make, and condition, influence its price. This model can serve as a valuable tool for various stakeholders in the automotive industry
